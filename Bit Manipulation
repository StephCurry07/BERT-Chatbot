/**
 * Optimized Bit Manipulation (With Early Exit)
 *
 * Number of bits in Int.MAX = log(Int.MAX) = 31 bits
 * Number of bits in sqrt(Int.MAX) = log(sqrt(Int.MAX)) = 16 bits.
 *
 * Thus we need to create a mask with 16 bits, where the 15th bit is set to 1 & rest are set to zero.
 *
 * In this solution we are setting each bit and checking if the result*(result+1)/2 is less than N,
 * else we do not set the bit in the result.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(16) = O(1)
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * N = Input number.

Bit Masking means to keep, change, or remove a desired part of information. Â· Bitmasking means imposing mask over bits
You can find,set,clear, count num of bits required to convert a number to another.
Use left and right shift operators.
Use an operation like and / or with a sequence of numbers to get the desired result.

~(x) inverts the bits.

##

n&(n-1)  -->  sets least significant bit to zero.
